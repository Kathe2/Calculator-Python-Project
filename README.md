# 🧮 Calculator – Python Project

A simple calculator program built in Python as part of **Day 10** of the *100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp* by [Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).  
The user can perform basic arithmetic operations in a loop until they choose to exit.

## 📌 Description

This calculator allows users to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The program is interactive and runs in the terminal, letting the user continue calculations with the previous result or start a new one.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3

## 💡 Features

- Supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**
- Runs continuously until the user exits
- Allows the user to continue calculating with the last result
- Clean, simple command-line interface

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run:

```bash
python main.py
